            A timeless symbol of love and architectural brilliance, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> stands as one of the most iconic landmarks in the world. 
            Situated in Agra, India, this breathtaking mausoleum is recognized as one of the <strong>New Seven Wonders of the World</strong>.

            <br>
            <br>
            <b>The History of the Taj Mahal</b><br>
            The Taj Mahal was commissioned in <strong>1632</strong> by the Mughal Emperor <strong>Shah Jahan</strong> in memory of his beloved wife, 
            <strong>Mumtaz Mahal</strong>. Construction of the mausoleum took over 20 years and involved the labor of more than 20,000 artisans, 
            including architects, masons, and craftsmen from across the empire and beyond. Completed in <strong>1653</strong>, the Taj Mahal is a 
            masterpiece that embodies the emperor's devotion and the grandeur of Mughal architecture.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>An Architectural and Artistic Marvel</b><br>
            The Taj Mahal is a harmonious blend of <strong>Persian, Islamic, and Indian architectural styles</strong>. Built using pristine white marble 
            sourced from Rajasthan, its intricate carvings and inlaid precious stones create an unparalleled sense of beauty. The symmetrical layout of the 
            complex, including the grand gateway, reflecting pools, and lush gardens, adds to its ethereal charm. The central dome, rising to a height of 
            <strong>73 meters</strong> (240 feet), is flanked by four elegant minarets, showcasing the symmetry and grandeur of the design.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>A Symbol of Love and Devotion</b><br>
            The Taj Mahal is more than an architectural wonder; it is a testament to undying love. Built as a mausoleum for Mumtaz Mahal, 
            it reflects Shah Jahan’s deep affection and his desire to immortalize their bond. For many, the Taj Mahal serves as a universal symbol 
            of love, inspiring awe and admiration across generations and cultures.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>The Construction Process</b><br>
            The construction of the Taj Mahal was a monumental undertaking. Artisans used advanced techniques to achieve its intricate details, 
            including inlay work with semi-precious stones like jade, lapis lazuli, and turquoise. The white marble was transported by an elaborate 
            network of carts and boats, highlighting the dedication and ingenuity of its builders. The entire complex is aligned with precision, 
            emphasizing symmetry and balance in every aspect of its design.

            <strong>UNESCO World Heritage Site</strong> in 1983, it has been the focus of preservation and restoration efforts to safeguard its beauty. 
            Measures to reduce air pollution and maintain the integrity of the structure ensure that the Taj Mahal continues to inspire awe for future generations.
